          My name's Adam. Since I was young, Iâ€™ve loved technology and design. I
          grew up in the early days of the internet, and it had a huge influence
          on me. I'm old enough to remember a time before our lives were
          dominanted by the massive platforms of today... where the internet was
          an exciting and uncharted field of discovery and information.
        </p>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          I want to be part of the community that examines and designs what the
          future of digital connectivity is.
        </p>
        <p style={paragraphStyles}>
          When Iâ€™m not working or in school, I like to spend my time playing
          video games, watching anime, reading, running, or lifting weights. Iâ€™m
          currently living &amp; working in the GTA, looking forward to life
          after the pandemic{' '}
