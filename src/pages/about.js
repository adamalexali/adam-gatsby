          <h2>My background</h2>
          <Paragraph>
            <BoldSpan>I'm Adam!</BoldSpan> I am a Canadian of Caribbean descent
            currently based in and around the Greater Toronto Area.

          <Paragraph>
            I started my post-secondary career at McMaster University, but ended
            up taking some time off to work before pivoting to interaction
            design & development at George Brown College, where I earned an
            advanced diploma. From there, I bridged into my current program,
            where I hope to receive my bachelor's in digital experience design
            within a few months!
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            Throughout my time at GBC, I've developed skills across a variety of
            disciplines, including{' '}
            <BoldSpan>
              UX research & design, interface design, content writing,
              human-machine interaction, usability, accessibility, XR &
              immersive environments, and data visualization
            </BoldSpan>
            . I aim to continue studying and developing skills in these areas
            beyond my academic career; as these are all fields of increasing
            importance in our digital society.

          <Paragraph>
            It was during my time at the college that I also became interested
            in not only the design aspect but also the development oneâ€”I wanted
            to learn how to actually build the products and services I was
            designing for! Over the past few years, I've been learning{' '}
            <BoldSpan>full-stack web development</BoldSpan> on my own time, and
            have recently taken up learning computer science more formally as I
            get more fascinated by AI & machine learning and their impact in the
            digital space. My goal is to have a diverse skillset that allows me
            to work effectively in cross-functional teams. Ultimately, I want to
            create a more <BoldSpan>accessible, inclusive, and open</BoldSpan>{' '}
            digital public space â€”in whatever ways I can achieve that!
