          <Paragraph>
            My name's Adam. Since I was young, Iâ€™ve loved technology and design.
            I grew up in the early days of the internet, and it had a huge
            influence on me. I'm old enough to remember a time before our lives
            were dominanted by the massive platforms of today... where the
            internet was an exciting and uncharted field of discovery and
            information.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            I want to be part of the community that examines and designs what
            the future of digital connectivity is.

            When Iâ€™m not working or in school, I like to spend my time playing
            video games, watching anime, reading, running, or lifting weights.
            Iâ€™m currently living &amp; working in the GTA, looking forward to
            life after the pandemic!{' '}
