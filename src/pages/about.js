          <Paragraph>
            As you've probably already figured out,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>I'm Adam!</BoldSpan> I am a Canadian of Caribbean descent
            currently based in and around the Greater Toronto Area.

          <Paragraph>
            I started my post-secondary career at McMaster University, but I
            eventually realized I wasn't enjoying what I was studying. I took
            some time off to work and pivoted to interaction design &
            development at George Brown College, earning an advanced diploma.
            From there, I bridged into my current program, where I hope to
            receive my bachelor's in digital experience design within a few
            months! Throughout my time at GBC, I've developed skills across a
            variety of disciplines, including <BoldSpan>UX</BoldSpan>,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>interface design</BoldSpan>,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>content writing</BoldSpan>,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>human-machine interaction</BoldSpan>,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>usability</BoldSpan>, <BoldSpan>accessibility</BoldSpan>,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>XR & immersive environments</BoldSpan>, and{' '}
            <BoldSpan>data visualization</BoldSpan>.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            It was during my time at the college that I also became interested
            in not only the design aspect but also the development oneâ€”I wanted
            to learn how to actually build the products and services I was
            designing for! Over the past few years, I've been learning{' '}
            <BoldSpan>full-stack web development</BoldSpan> on my own time, and
            have recently taken up learning computer science more formally as I
            get more fascinated by AI & machine learning and their impact in the
            digital space. My goal is to have a diverse skillset that allows me
            to work effectively in cross-functional teams. Ultimately, I want to
            create a more <BoldSpan>accessible</BoldSpan>,{' '}
            <BoldSpan>inclusive</BoldSpan>, and <BoldSpan>open</BoldSpan>{' '}
            digital public spaceâ€”in whatever ways I can achieve that!
