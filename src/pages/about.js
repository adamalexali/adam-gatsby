          <Paragraph>
            I am currently a student at George Brown College, completing a
            Honours Bachelor of Digital Experience Design. Before that, I
            studied and received an Advanced Diploma in Interaction Design, also
            from George Brown. I've also self-taught myself software development
            and computer science in my spare time.

          <Paragraph>
            Throughout my academic and professional career, I've worked
            "end-to-end"; i.e., I do work within a number of different roles
            throughout the design process. This includes discovery, research,
            wireframing, prototyping, interaction design &amp; development, and
            user testing.
          </Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>
            I find having a wide range of knowledge &amp; skills allows me to
            work well and communicate effectively in cross-functional teams.
